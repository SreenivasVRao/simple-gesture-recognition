#Simple Hand Recognition

To build your own gesture dictionary, run

python store_examples.py

Press 'c' to capture gestures. 
Press 'q' to save and quit.


To identify gestures, run

python identify_gesture.py

Press 'i' to identify.

#Algorithm

The program expects the user to place a hand in the bounding box specified. The largest contour by area is calculated, and it is assumed to be the hand/gesture. cv2.matchShapes() is called on the contour in the bounding box, and each of the contours in the gesture dictionary. The similarity measure is calculated based on one of the ShapeMatchModes given here: http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/df/d4e/group__imgproc__c.html#gacd971ae682604ff73cdb88645725968d

A low similarity measure corresponds to a high degree of matching between two contours. 

composite_list.npy contains a set of predefined gestures. These are available at:
